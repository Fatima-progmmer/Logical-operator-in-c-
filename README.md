# 🔢 Logical Operators in C  

This project demonstrates the usage of **Logical Operators in C**, which are essential for decision-making and conditional statements in programming.  

## 🌟 Overview  
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations in C. These operators return either **true (1)** or **false (0)** based on the given conditions.  

## 🛠️ Logical Operators in C  
| Operator | Description | Example |  
|----------|------------|---------|  
| `&&` (AND) | Returns true if both conditions are true | `(a > 5 && b < 10)` |  
| `||` (OR) | Returns true if at least one condition is true | `(a > 5 || b < 10)` |  
| `!` (NOT) | Reverses the logical state of a condition | `!(a > 5)` |  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fatima-progmmer/Logical-operator-in-c-.git
   ```  
2. Open the C file (`logical_operators.c`) in a C compiler.  
3. Compile and run the program:  
   ```bash
   gcc logical_operators.c -o logical_operators
   ./logical_operators
   ```

## 💡 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Add more examples for nested conditions  
🔹 Include interactive user input for better understanding  
🔹 Create a menu-driven program for logical operations
